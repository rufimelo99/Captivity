## Introduction

Captivity is a 2D, co-op medieval adventure game for Windows PC with a bird’s-eye view perspective. The players control two human characters that move together through the levels of the game, by overcoming obstacles and fighting enemies. They will occasionally encounter imprisoned spirits, attaining powers from them once they are freed. One of the key aspects of the game will be the ability that the players will have to combine the powers of their characters. The game ends with a final fight with the Wizard who was keeping the spirits imprisoned. We will often use terms of the game to describe certain entities and situations. In the last section of the document we added an index with the meaning of these terms.
